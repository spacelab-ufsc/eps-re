## Overview

The Reliability Enhanced EPS has been designed to harvest, store and distribute energy for a future SpaceLab's mission. The energy harvesting system is based on solar energy conversion through 10 solar panels attached to the structure. This EPS is designed to operate the solar panels at their maximum power point. The harvested solar energy is stored in 4 lithium-ion batteries connected in series/parallel. The energy distribution is done by several integrated DC-DC converters. The EPS designed is almost all analog, and therefore more reliable when considering the impact of radiation on the system.

## Repository Organization
	- doc: Technical documentation (including mechanical structure, hardware, user guide, and datasheet).
	- hardware: Sun simulator's hardware project (sources and outputs).

## License

This project is open-source under three different licenses: CERN Open Hardware License v2.0 for hardware, and CC BY-SA 4.0 for the documentation.
